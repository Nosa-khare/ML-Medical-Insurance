# ML-Medical-Insurance

## Overview 
This project aims to build a machine learning prediction model to estimate the medical costs of individuals based on various predictor variables provided in the dataset. The dataset, named "insurance.csv," contains real-life patient data with information on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the number of children covered by health insurance, smoking habits, region, and individual medical costs billed by medical insurance.  

## Project Tasks

### a) Data Exploration
Before building the prediction model, we need to explore the dataset to gain a better understanding of the data. Observations and insights will be documented as part of this process.

### b) Correlation Analysis 
We will study the correlation between each predictor variable (age, gender, BMI, children, smoking habits, region) and the medical cost. The goal is to identify the relationships between these variables and the target variable (medical cost) and draw meaningful conclusions from the correlation analysis.

### c) Simple Linear Regression 
Using the results from the correlation analysis, we will select the three best predictor variables and build simple linear regression models for each of these predictors. This will help us understand how each individual predictor contributes to the prediction of medical costs.

### d) Performance Evaluation 
The performance of the models built in the previous step will be evaluated using statistical performance measures to assess the statistical significance of the results. We will use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.

### e) Multivariate Regression Models 
Two multivariate regression models will be created. The first model will use the three best predictors identified in the correlation analysis, while the second model will use all available predictors in the dataset. These models will be evaluated and compared to determine which one performs better in estimating medical costs.  

### f) Conclusion 
In the final step, we will provide overall conclusions for this task. This includes a summary of the insights gained from data exploration, the effectiveness of the models in predicting medical costs, and any recommendations or further steps that may be required based on the project's findings.
